tiles.png creates the tile layout for the level.

entities.png creates the entity layout.
the r value of each pixel determines the tile or entity type
for entities:
1 = player
2-4 = regular monster types
5 = boss monster
6-7 = items
8 = level completion orb
9-11 = npcs

the top-right pixel in the tiles.png will be the default background tile. if it isn't filled in (as in a white pixel) it will
default to being an all black tile

there's a bizarre bug where if tiles.png image has less than 16 distinct rgb values,
the bufferedImage "flattens" and makes them go to nearest 3rd value floored (eg 7,0,0 becomes 5,0,0)
i dont know what causes this or how to prevent it other than having some dummy pixels in tiles.png 
with r values that will go the default
